Night Out is designed to be an interactive app that allows the user to plan their “night out”. The main function of the app is tracking user location to display bars near them, as well as, display the statistics of a selected bar. The app includes interactive features like a scrollable map, a drop down menu with bars, and clickable markers on their respective bar locations.

Expected Future updates:
1. Database implementation to track users
2. Make use of a Geolocation API to update bar capacity in real time
