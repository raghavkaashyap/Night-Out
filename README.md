Night Out is designed to be an interactive app built with React Native and Expo that allows the user to plan their “night out”. The main function of the app is tracking user location to display bars/restaurants near them, as well as, display the statistics of a selected bar/restaurant. The app includes interactive features like a scrollable map, a drop down menu with bars/restaurant, and clickable markers on their respective bar locations.

Key Features:
1. Interactive Map: Includes a scrollable map with clickable markers on each bar's/restaurant's location.
2. Bar/Restaurant Selection: Users can choose bars from a dropdown menu for quick access to information.
3. Statistics Display: Provides key data about each selected bar/restaurant, enhancing the decision-making process.

Expected Future updates:
1. Database Implementation: Track users and their preferences for a more personalized experience.
2. Real-Time Bar Capacity: Integrate a Geolocation API to update and display bar/restaurant capacity in real-time.
